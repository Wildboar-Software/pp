Grey book interface.

This interface is for the grey book protocol running over Blue book
file transfer protocol. This is a JANET specific protocol.

The files in this directory represent only the PP specific parts of
the interface. PP is designed to make use of the unix-niftp public
domain package to complete this channel. If you do not currently have
this package you will not make much headway!

The particular unix-niftp you need should have the appropriate hooks
in for PP. This requires the latest version of unix-niftp.

This is obtainable from Piete Brooks at cambridge university (pb@uk.ac.cam.cl).
You can get information on the current unix-niftp version from him or
from the info-server at cambridge.

If you have problems with this - or are confused, drop a note to the
pp-support address and we will see if something can be sorted out.
