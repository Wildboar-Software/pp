This directory contains several configurations. This includes
some real configurations, and some "unreal" configurations.

Currently, the real configurations reflect what is being used
at X-Tel.

The unreal configurations are meant to help you get started the first
time, they are not meant for serious use. They will get you started
but after that you must hand configure to your specific requirements.
The sample unreal configuration are targeted towards the following:

LOCALSMTP - a site with local deliver and limited smtp capabilities.
	Local mail will be delivered locally, all other mail will be
	pushed by smtp to a site which can deal with it.

JANET - a site on JANET with access to the NRS database and some local
	smtp capability.

INTERNET - a site on the internet with access to the full Domain Name
	Server tree and full SMTP interconnectivity.
