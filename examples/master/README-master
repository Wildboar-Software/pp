%BEGIN(J)	
This configuration is meant to be a simplistic Janet configuration. It
does only the basics to get the system going. A proper janet site
needs tables building directly from the nrs database.
.LP
This configuration relies on the grey book channel having been built.
This should be built in conjunction with the unix-niftp package. The
full channel and domain table should be built by the c-nrs processor
in PP mode.
%END(J)
%BEGIN(I)
The configuration presented here is intended to be that used by a
"normal" internet site. This means that the site should have a direct
IP connection to the Internet and make use of the DNS.
%END(I)
%BEGIN(L)
The configuration presented here is intended to be that used by a
a site with local smtp capability. The configuration will allow
delivery to a few local users and send all remote traffic to a single
host.
%END(L)
.LP
This is intended to be a first step that will get messages delivered to
a few selected people and make very little use of the more advanced
features.
.LP
To configure this version for use, do the following.
.nr Ct 0 1
.IP \n+(Ct.
Run make install in this directory. This will install the files in the
correct places.
.DS
% ./make install
.DE
.IP \n+(Ct.
Edit the installed tailor file (%TAILOR%) to configure the site specific
parameters near the beginning of this file.
.DS
% vi %TAILOR%
.DE
.IP \n+(Ct.
Add the contents of the file isoentities.add to your system wide
isoentities file (usually either in /usr/etc). You will probably need
to be root to do this step.
.DS
% su
Password:
# vi /usr/etc/isoentities
.DE
This step is useful as a backup anyway, but if you have all your
applications registered in the X.500 directory, you should add such an
entry to that too. A sample entry is given in x500.sample. This should
be added (after editing) at the same position as your other local applications.
.DS
% dish -u <manager>
Welcome to Dish (DIrectory SHell)
Enter password for "<manager>":
Dish -> moveto cn=<machine>
Dish -> add "cn=pp qmgr" -objectclass "applicationEntity & quipuObject"
.DE
.IP \n+(Ct.
Change directory to the tables directory (%TABLES%).
.DS
% cd %TABLES%
.DE
.IP \n+(Ct.
Edit the users file and add a few local users using the format
given in that file.
.DS
% vi users
.DE
.IP \n+(Ct.
Edit the ch.local file and add the same users to that file.
.DS
% vi ch.local
.DE
%BEGIN(J)
.IP \n+(Ct.
Edit the channel and domain table and make the changes suggested
there.
.DS
% vi channel domain
.DE
%END(J)
%BEGIN(L)
.IP \n+(Ct.
Edit the channel and domain tables. In particular replace the strings
LOC-DOM-MTA, LOC-DOM-SITE and SMTP-RELAY with suitable hostnames.
.DS
% vi channel domain
.DE
%END(L)
.IP \n+(Ct.
Run dbmbuild (found in directory %CMDDIR%).
.DS
% %CMDDIR%/dbmbuild -v
.DE
.IP \n+(Ct.
Run ckconfig (found in the directory %CMDDIR%) and see if everything looks
reasonable.
.DS
% %CMDDIR%/ckconfig
.DE
.IP \n+(Ct.
Start the pptsapd and the qmgr
.DS
% %CMDDIR%/pptsapd >& /dev/null
% %CMDDIR%/qmgr >& /dev/null
.DE
.IP \n+(Ct.
Add an appropriate line to the /etc/inetd.conf file to allow smtp
incoming connections. An example might be
.DS
smtp stream tcp nowait pp /usr/pp/cmds/chans/smtpsrvr smtpsrvr smtp
.DE
After this you will need to do a kill -HUP on the inetd process to get
it to reread the configuration file.
If you are running another smtp service (e.g sendmail), make sure this
is no longer running.
.DS
% su
Password:
# vi /etc/inetd.conf
# ps -x
# kill -HUP <pid>
.DE
.LP
PP should now be ready for use. At this point it is worth testing out
a few things. Some simple tests are as follows:
.LP
Submit a message to local user you configured in and see if it is
delivered. This is easiest done by using the PP supplied mail program.
This is normally installed in the %CMDDIR% directory. A command such as
.DS
% %CMDDIR%/mail -s test pp < /etc/motd
.DE
is a good start.
.LP
Submit a message to some other local machine using the same syntax as
above.
.LP
If that works too, try a message to someone further afield. Use the
same method, just pick a remote address for testing.
.LP
This configuration is meant only to get you started. Once this is
running you will almost certainly want to do some of the following.
.IP o
Add all your users to the users and ch.local table by means of some
shell/awk script from local databases.
.IP o
Create some lists to be expanded by the list channel.
.IP o
Rebuild the domain and channel tables to take account of local knowledge.
.IP o
Add in the ability to use X.400. This is at present rather too
complicated to automate.
%BEGIN(J)
.IP o
For the addressign of all sites on JANET, you should process the nrs
database. There is a program available to do this, c-nrs. It is
available from pb@cam.cl and has a PP mode which will produce suitable
output for PP.
%END(J)
.LP
Full details for all these procedures are laid out in Volume 1 of the
PP manual.
