There is known but elusive bug somewhere in the MTAconsole.
Occasionally the MTAconsole falls over and core dumps within the
routine  XawFormDoLayout ().
This appears to happen if there is a substantial decrease in the
number of mtas displayed for a particular channel while the console is
in monitor mode.
Any help in diagnosing this problem would be very welcome.
Please note that this does not appear to make the MTAconsole unusable.
In our experience, the problem occurs infrequently.
