The next release of PP will be available on December 20, 1991. This
release will be known as


                               PP 6.0


PP is a Message Transfer Agent, intended for high volume message
switching, protocol conversion, and format conversion. It is targeted for
use in an operational environment, but is also be useful for investigating
message related applications. Good management features are a major
aspect of this system. PP supports the 1984 and 1988 versions of the
CCITT X.400 / ISO 10021 services and protocols. Many existing RFC 822
based protocols are supported, along with RFC 1148bis conversion to
X.400. PP is an appropriate replacement for MMDF or Sendmail.
This is the second public release of PP, and includes substantial changes
based on feedback from using PP on many sites.


   o PP is not proprietary and can be used for any purpose. The only
     restriction is that suing of the authors for any damage the code may
     cause is not allowed.


   o PP runs on a range of UNIX and UNIX-like operating systems,
     including SUNOS, Ultrix, and BSD. A full list of platforms on which
     PP is know to run is included in the distribution.


   o Current modules include:


       -  X.400 (1984) P1 protocol.

       -  X.400 (1988) P1 protocol.

       -  Simple mail transfer protocol (SMTP), conformant to host
          requirements.

       -  JNT mail (grey book) Protocol.

       -  UUCP mail transfer.

       -  DECNET Mail-11 transfer

       -  Distribution list expansion and maintenance, using either a file
          based mechanism or an X.500 directory.

       -  RFC 822-based local delivery.

       -  Delivery time processing of messages.

       -  Conversion between X.400 and RFC 822 according to the latest
          revision of RFC 1148, known as RFC 1148bis.

       -  Conversion support for reformatting body parts and headers.

       -  X-Window and line-based management console.

       -  Message Authorisation checking.

       -  Reformatting support for "mail hub" operation.

       -  X.500-based distribution list facility using the QUIPU directory.



                                  1




       -  FAX interworking


   o No User Agents (UAs) are included with PP. However, procedural
     access to the MTA is documented, to encourage others to write or to
     port UAs. Several existing UAs, such as MH, may be used with PP.


   o It is expected that a Message Store to be used in conjunction with
     PP (PPMS), and an associated X-Windows User Agent (XUA) will
     be released on beta test in first quarter 92.


   o The core routing of PP 6.0 is table based. DNS is used by the SMTP
     channel. The next version of PP will support Directory Based
     routing, which may use X.500 or DNS.


   o PP 6.0 requires ISODE 7.0.


   o X-Windows release X11R4 (or greater) is needed by some of the
     management tools. PP can be operated without these tools.


   o Although PP is not "supported" per se (but see later), it does have a
     problem reporting address:



     RFC 822: PP-SUPPORT@CS.UCL.AC.UK


     X.400:    S=PP-Support; OU=CS; O=UCL;
               PRMD=UK.AC; ADMD= ; C=GB;



     Bug reports (and fixes) are welcome.


   o The discussion group PP-PEOPLE@CS.UCL.AC.UK is used as an
     open forum on PP; Contact
     PP-PEOPLE-REQUEST@CS.UCL.AC.UK to be added to this list.


   o The primary documentation for this release consists of a three and a
     half volume User's Manual (approx. 300 pages) and a set of UNIX
     manual pages. The sources to the User's Manual are in LaTeX
     format.
