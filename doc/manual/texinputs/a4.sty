% "a4" document style option.
% John Pavel, December 1986
%
% Redefines the \textheight and \topmargin for A4 paper, as opposed to US paper.
%
% Adjusting \textheight will adjust position of the bottom of the page.
% Must preserve "(\textheight - \topskip) divides \baselineskip".
% \topskip always appears to be 10pt.
% So only add/subtract multiples of \baselineskip if you want shorter pages.
%
% \textwidth is not altered because A4 is narrower than US paper.
%
%
\topmargin 0 pt     %    Nominal distance from top of paper to top of page
\ifcase \@ptsize
    % mods for 10 pt (\baselineskip=12pt)
    \textheight 646 pt  % Height of text (including footnotes and figures)
\or % mods for 11 pt (\baselineskip=13.6pt)
    \textheight 649.2 pt    % Height of text (including footnotes and figures)
\or % mods for 12 pt  (\baselineskip=15pt)
    \textheight 655 pt    % Height of text (including footnotes and figures)
