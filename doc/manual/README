~pp/doc/manual/README
---------------------
The PP manual is contained in the three directories volume1, 2 and 3.
Each shares some files from the directory /texinputs.

	Four subdirectories
		volume0/
			Introduction and credits
		volume1/
			Installation and Operation
		volume2/
			Programmers Manual.
		volume3/
			PP user manual

By default these documents use the a4.sty style to produce a4 paper
output. If you don't use a4 paper - create an empty file a4.sty in 
each directory and this will disable this feature.
