PP is a Message Transfer Agent, intended for high volume message
switching, protocol conversion, and format conversion.  It is targeted
for use in an operational environment, but is also be useful for
investigating message related applications.  Good management features
are a major aspect of this system.  PP supports the 1984 and 1988
versions of the CCITT X.400 / ISO 10021 services and protocols.  Many
existing RFC~822 based protocols are supported, along with RFC~1148bis
conversion to X.400.  PP is an appropriate replacement for MMDF or
Sendmail.

This is the second public release of PP, and includes substantial
changes based on feedback from using PP on many sites.
