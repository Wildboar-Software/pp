[ README for the Tools/misc directory - jpo Tue Mar 28 15:53:21 1989 ]

The files in this directory are intended for use in debuging PP and
for doing simple tasks. They are as follows.

adrchk - does a variety of strange things with a given address to see
	if it's parseable and if so in what manner.

norm -	Attempts to normalise a list of addresses given as arguments
	to the program. It has two flags -t type specifies the type of
	ordering you want to try (pick from uk, us, ukpref, uspref)
	and -a which syas try all address styles.

testrfc - A program to check and see how the RFC/UTC time strings
	interwork - if at all. Type in an RFC style string and it will
	convert it to a UTC time structure, print that out as both
	universal & generalised time - then convert it back to RFC and
	you should have something similar to the input (except the
	timezone may have been normalised).
