Files in this directory are the preferred format for the pp system.
Add new file types as needed. The format is not particularly
important, but I think it looks ok and it has most of the essential
info in it.

A brief note about some of the formats.

template.py
	Don't forget to set the comment leader for RCS, else you'll
	get some funny results. Basically, the first time you co a .py
	file - the following is the easiest way.
		ci filename.py
		rcs -c'-- ' filename.py
		co [-l] filename.py

template.mk
	This should include the following targets so that recursive
	things work properly.
	default	- the default things to build.
	clean	- clean out all the junk.
	lint	- lint the files. Should be a target for each separate
		systm as well though. e.g.
		lint: l-prog1 l-prog2
		so that they can be lint'd separately if needed.
	install	- installation method (one day! - leave blank for now)
	depend	- rebuild dependency list
	
template.man
	Use for -ms & -man macro - but remove the TH for ms. Also need
	to set the comment string here. Use rcs -c'.\" ' file.
